# Spacescapes Course Wrapper

This project is meant as wrapper content for a course I am developing. The reason for this wrapper, is that the site that I am
using to distribute the course only allows for files downloads. The wrapper is meant to give the user the ability to have the
content organized in a meaningful way.

The course will be available for free / pay-what-you-want on Gumroad on Feb 28th, 2017. It covers the basics of Adobe After Effects, Illustrator, and Photoshop and is targeted at a beginner audience. The goal of the course is to give new users a workflow that allows them to use the software and create something interesting. This is in a hope to build their interest in the software and continue learning.
